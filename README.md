**Abstract**

Gaze estimation which aims to predict gaze points given eye images is an important task in computer vision because of its applications in human visual attention understanding. Many existing methods are based on single camera, and most of them only focus on either gaze point estimation or gaze direction estimation. In this paper, we propose a novel multi-task method for gaze point estimation by using multi-view cameras. Specifically, we analyze the close relationship between the gaze point estimation and gaze direction estimation, and we use a partially shared convolutional neural networks architecture to simultaneously estimate gaze direction and gaze point. Further, we also introduce a new multi-view gaze tracking dataset which consists of multi-view eye images of different subjects. As far as we know, it is the largest multi-view gaze tracking dataset. Comprehensive experiments on our multi-view gaze tracking dataset and existing datasets demonstrate that our multi-view multi-task gaze point estimation solution consistently outperforms existing methods.
